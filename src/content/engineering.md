When posed with a problem, I try to imagine what what someone much smarter than myself would do... for example, [Landon Curt Noll](https://share.google/JhOZsDrbz6mCiIPrC) and [W. Edwards Deming](https://share.google/ODVJZG62MzOUCnWHV)...

Perhaps having a drink, at a hotel bar. After a last conference session. Landon has his badge flipped backward. Deming orders scotch, neat. The stool between them is empty.

**Deming:** You're the one who uses lava lamps for cryptography.

**Landon:** And you're the one who tells executives they're the problem.

**Deming:** They are the problem.

**Landon:** I've met the executives. I don't disagree. But I build things. I can't wait for management to become enlightened.

**Deming:** And how do your things hold up when the system around them is broken?

**Landon:** Better than you'd expect. Worse than they should.

*Deming takes his scotch.*

**Deming:** You test by trying to destroy what you build.

**Landon:** When destruction becomes impossible, I approach sufficiency.

**Deming:** Interesting word. *Approach.* You don't say achieve.

**Landon:** I've held eight world records. Sufficiency is asymptotic.

**Deming:** Most engineers would have said "achieve." You understand something they don't.

**Landon:** That quality isn't a destination.

**Deming:** That quality isn't a destination. Yes.

*Neither speaks for a moment.*

**Landon:** You say we can't test quality into a product. I've spent thirty years testing.

**Deming:** And what has testing taught you?

**Landon:** Where the process failed.

**Deming:** Exactly. Testing is detective work. Noble work. But the murder has already happened.

**Landon:** So you'd have me build processes so good that testing becomes—

**Deming:** Confirmatory. Not investigatory.

**Landon:** That's a beautiful distinction that has never once survived contact with a production deadline.

**Deming:** The organization that forgets quality in pursuit of speed achieves neither.

**Landon:** I know. I've watched it happen. I wrote a contest about it.

**Deming:** The obfuscated code contest.

**Landon:** Satirical programming. You learn to hate bad code by celebrating it.

**Deming:** I have a red bead experiment. Same principle. You learn to hate bad management by performing it.

**Landon:** You make executives scoop beads and yell at them for the color.

**Deming:** And they laugh. Then they realize I am describing their Tuesday.

*Landon actually laughs.*

**Landon:** We're doing the same thing.

**Deming:** We have always been doing the same thing.

*Ice settling in glasses.*

**Landon:** I believe in simplicity. Not simplistic—*simple*. Every layer independently verifiable.

**Deming:** You are describing the reduction of variation. Complexity is where defects hide.

**Landon:** Complexity is where *confusion* hides. Defects are just confusion's children.

**Deming:** That is well said.

**Landon:** I also believe in idempotency. Run it once or a thousand times, same result.

**Deming:** A process in statistical control.

**Landon:** I call it courtesy. To the person who runs it after me at three in the morning when something is on fire.

**Deming:** Respect for people. That is my Point Twelve. Remove the barriers that rob people of pride in their work.

**Landon:** I don't number my principles.

**Deming:** I have fourteen. Perhaps too many.

**Landon:** I have five. Perhaps too few.

**Deming:** How many do you need?

**Landon:** Quality above all. Respect human time. Keep it simple. Finish what you start. Make it safe to run again.

**Deming:** Constancy of purpose. Drive out fear. Cease dependence on inspection. Break down barriers. Improve the system forever.

*They look at each other's hands. Five and five.*

**Landon:** Those aren't that different.

**Deming:** They are the same things learned in different rooms.

**Landon:** You learned yours in boardrooms.

**Deming:** I learned mine in factories. The boardrooms came later, and reluctantly.

**Landon:** I learned mine in machine rooms. Late nights when the only one who'd tell you the truth was the compiler.

**Deming:** The compiler has no politics.

**Landon:** The compiler has no fear.

**Deming:** And that is why your systems are better than your organizations.

**Landon:** And that is why you spend your life trying to fix the organizations.

*They drink.*

**Deming:** It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.

**Landon:** I tell them nothing. I write the code. If it's good enough, they use it. If not, the universe tells me.

**Deming:** The universe is a slow teacher.

**Landon:** But an honest one.

**Deming:** I am ninety-three. I have given this seminar hundreds of times. I have not convinced enough of them.

**Landon:** I've been writing code since I was fourteen. The same mistakes repeat.

**Deming:** Then why do we continue?

**Landon:** Because every year, someone shows me something I didn't think was possible.

**Deming:** Because I am responsible for making a difference.

*The bar is emptying. Conference badges litter the tables.*

**Landon:** One more?

**Deming:** I write the date on my eggs so I eat the oldest first. I do not waste things. Including time.

**Landon:** That's a yes or a no?

**Deming:** That is a yes. But not for small talk.

**Landon:** Deal. Tell me about variation.

**Deming:** Tell me about prime numbers.

*The bartender pours two more. The conversation goes on—as it always does between people who build things and people who study why things break, when they finally discover they've been sitting at the same bar all along.*

And then I make every attempt to do ***that***.
