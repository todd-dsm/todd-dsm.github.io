There's a common assumption in our industry: as you move into leadership, you stop writing code. You're supposed to "elevate" to strategy, delegation, and meetings.

I disagree.

## The Credibility Gap

When a leader hasn't touched code in years, something happens in technical discussions. Engineers can sense it. The questions get softer. The pushback disappears. And slowly, the leader becomes disconnected from the reality of what their team actually builds.

I've seen architects propose solutions that look elegant on a whiteboard but fall apart the moment you try to implement them. Why? Because they forgot what implementation feels like.

## Leading from the Front

At every role in my career—from Sr. DevOps Engineer to Principal Architect to Senior Manager—I've kept my hands in the code. Not because I don't trust my team, but because:

1. **Context matters.** When I review a PR, I understand the tradeoffs because I've made similar ones recently.
2. **Empathy is earned.** I know what it feels like when CI is slow, when docs are outdated, when the abstraction leaks.
3. **Credibility compounds.** Engineers work harder for leaders who can actually help them solve problems.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

I'm not writing production features—that's what my team is for. But I am:

- **Prototyping** — When evaluating a new tool or pattern, I build a proof of concept myself before asking the team to invest time.
- **Automating** — If I see repetitive work, I'll script it. The GitOps pipelines at PIMCO and Panasonic started as my prototypes.
- **Debugging** — When something breaks at 2am, I'm not just watching Slack. I'm in the terminal.

## The Counterargument

"But Todd, shouldn't leaders focus on strategy and let the team execute?"

Yes—and no. Strategy without execution knowledge is fantasy. The best leaders I've worked with could drop into any layer of the stack and contribute. They chose not to because their time was better spent elsewhere, not because they couldn't.

There's a difference between choosing to delegate and being forced to because you've lost the skill.

## Staying Sharp

Here's my approach:

- **Side projects** — This site is built with Astro and Tailwind. I wrote every line.
- **Tool evaluation** — When we consider new tech, I build with it first.
- **Pair programming** — Sometimes I'll pair with a junior engineer. They learn, I stay current.
- **Open source** — Contributing upstream keeps you honest about code quality.

## The Bottom Line

Engineering leadership isn't about graduating from technical work. It's about expanding your impact while maintaining the credibility that comes from actually understanding the work.

I still write code because it makes me a better leader. And I'm skeptical of any engineering leader who doesn't.
