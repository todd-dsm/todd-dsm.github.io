I like keeping my teeth sharp; simple as that. I love producing logical constructs, flexible mechanisms and as close as I can get to creating a perpetual motion machine. I know it's impossible...

Also, the further removed from the issues and solutions, the less effective one becomes. The thought of being ineffective...

## The Credibility Gap

When a leader hasn't touched code in years, something happens in technical discussions. Other engineers can smell it. When they sense lack of depth, the questions soften, they lose hope, then you're just another suit. This is the thin end of the wedge. Then, slowly, the leader becomes disconnected from the team - and what the team actually builds.

## Leading from the Front

Leadership is finding yourself in a dark place, picking up the flashlight and pointing it in a logical direction. Then, you start finding your way out of the darkness.

At every role in my career—from DevOps Engineer to Senior Manager—I've kept my hands in the code. Not because I don't trust my team, but because:

1. **Context matters.** When I review a PR, I understand the tradeoffs because I've made similar ones recently.
2. **Empathy is earned.** I know what it feels like when CI is slow, when docs are outdated, when the abstraction leaks.
3. **Credibility compounds.** Engineers work harder for leaders who can actually help them solve problems.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

I'm not writing production terraform code—that's what my team is for. But I am:

- **Experimenting** — Exploring new tools to see if we can do the same work, but with less sweat.
- **Automating** — When I see repetitive work, it's an automation opportunity; GitOps covers a lot of work, but not everything.
- **Debugging** — When something breaks at 2am, I'm not just watching Slack. I'm capturing failure conditions, then figuring out how those conditions were allowed to occur and to mitigate them in the future.

## The Counterargument

"But, shouldn't leaders focus on strategy and let the team execute?"

Yes—and no. Strategy without execution knowledge is fantasy. The best leaders I've worked with could drop into any team, ask a few questions and start contributing. They chose not to because their time was better spent elsewhere, not because they couldn't.

There's a difference between choosing to delegate and being forced to because you've lost the skill.

## Staying Sharp

Here's my approach:

- **Tool Evaluation** — When we consider new tech, I build with it first.
  - My partner found a new Observability (OTEL) suite: [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/)
  - The promise of an Open Source Datadog? I'll take all I can get.
- **Side Projects** — this site is built with Astro and Tailwind.
- **Co-Op Programming** — Sometimes paired, sometimes solo, sometimes crowd. It depends on the day.
- **Open source** — Contributing upstream keeps you honest about code quality.

## The Bottom Line

Engineering leadership isn't about graduating from technical work. It's about expanding your impact by enabling those who are next in line. You do that right, the credibility comes on its own.

I still write code because it makes me a better leader. But also, the sharp teeth.
